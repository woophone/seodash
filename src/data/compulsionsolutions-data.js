The book has 766 reviews on Amazon (4.5+ stars) and 468 ratings on Goodreads (4.18 stars, 77% rated 4-5 stars). The book IS referenced on the site — it appears on the quiz page and homepage — but only as small text promoting a free chapter download. It's being used as a lead magnet, not as an authority signal. No author byline cites it, no structured data references it, and there's no prominent display connecting George Collins the site owner to George Collins the published expert.",
      whyItMatters: "Google's E-E-A-T guidelines cite \"published works\" and \"external reputation\" as top-tier authority evidence for YMYL health content. A published book from a legitimate psychology publisher with 1,234 combined ratings across platforms is the strongest possible author authority signal — and it's currently invisible to Google. The book needs to be repositioned from newsletter incentive to authority centerpiece.",

The site uses Yoast SEO which generates WebPage and BreadcrumbList schema — but no Person or Book types. Without schema.org sameAs links, Google's Knowledge Graph cannot associate the site's content author with the published book author. These are treated as potentially unrelated entities.",
      whyItMatters: "Person schema with sameAs links is the technical mechanism that connects an on-site author to their external authority signals. Without it, Google doesn't know the person writing YMYL health content is the same person with 766 Amazon reviews from a legitimate publisher. For YMYL content, this connection determines whether Google sees a random health website or a recognized expert's platform.",
